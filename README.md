# Inspired by

[WhatPanel](https://github.com/paimpozhil/WhatPanel) - but instead of CentOS, I focus on simplifying deployment with latest Ubuntu LTS.

# Benefits

So you own a cheap VPS and has setuped your perfect server. Your VPS provider doesn't have snapshot backup or provide little to no backup; and you don't want to mess with your server current configuration. Docker comes to the rescue. You can use this project or similar Docker project to provide a stable and secure environment for hosting.
